          <h2 class = "Journey"> My Journey With Information Technology </h2>
         <p> After graduating from High School in Iraq i had no idea what program/department i wanted to study. 
        I thought about Med School, Engineering, Biology and many more. But i was advised to choose a program that i enjoyed. which made me think more deeply about my interests.
       I also had a hard time choosing what University i wanted but at the end I chose a university which taught in English in Iraq but, i still hadn't chosen a program.
        At University i studied the General courses for 5 months then the Administration told me i must choose a department before the 2nd semester started. So, i chose IT and took programming courses and ended up loving it. i was very happy and relieved that i finally chose a program which i enjoyed.
        After a year and a half of studying IT in iraq i decided to come to the Netherlands for studying. and of course, i chose Information Technology again as my program.
