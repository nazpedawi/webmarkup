            <p>Welcome to my About me Page! I'm Naz but most people call me Naze. I'm Kurdish and have lived in Kurdistan, Iraq my whole life. but recently i have moved to the netherlands for the purpose of studying.
                Currently i'm a first year student of Information Technology at Inholland Hogeschool in Haarlem.
                Before i came to Inholland, i studied Information Technology for 1 and a half years at a University back home in Iraq.
                which helped me get a bit of experience with programming, design and database systems.
            </p>
